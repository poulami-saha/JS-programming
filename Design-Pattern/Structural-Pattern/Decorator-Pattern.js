//The Decorator pattern lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing them inside 
//wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. 
//If we think how React Context we can see that we're passing a component 
//as a child to this HOC, and thanks to that 
//this child component is able to access certain features.

// This pattern includes the following examples like in VanillaJS, 
// the addEventListener observes the events like, "click", "keyUp"
// The callback function attached as teh second parameter will fire as soon as the event is observed.


//In React useEffect hook observes for the array parameters, change of which 
//will lead to the event execution that is the function that is send as the first parameter here

//RxJs operators responds to its observers upon completion when we use in Angular, the asynchronous functions and the operators helps to observe

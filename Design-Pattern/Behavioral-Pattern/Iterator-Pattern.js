//for...in, for...of, forEach, map, reduce, filter

//Chain of Responsibility Pattern

//Couple of responsibilities are assigned one after the another upon completion of each task.

// A typical front-end app that consumes an API could work as an example:

// We have a function responsible for rendering a UI component.

// Once rendered, a another function makes a request to an API endpoint.

// If the endpoint response is as expected, the information is passed to another 
//function that sorts the data in a given way and stores it in a variable.

// Once that variable stores the needed information, another function is responsible of 
//rendering it in the UI.
